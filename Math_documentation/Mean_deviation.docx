Got it! To determine whether to use absolute differences or not, it helps to understand the specific goal of your analysis:
Absolute Differences vs. Regular Differences

Absolute Differences:
Purpose: Measures the magnitude of deviation between elements, ignoring the direction of the deviation. Useful when you want to focus on the size of the differences without regard to whether they are positive or negative.
Example Use Case: If you are comparing temperature variations between two sets of data and want to understand how different they are in magnitude, you’d use absolute differences.

Regular Differences:
Purpose: Measures the actual difference, including direction. This can be useful if you want to understand how elements in one set are higher or lower than the elements in another set.
Example Use Case: If you are comparing test scores from two different sets and want to see whether one set of scores is generally higher or lower, you’d use regular differences.

Which to Use?
If Your Goal is to Evaluate Deviation Magnitude: Use absolute differences to understand how far apart the sets are, regardless of the direction of deviation.
If Your Goal is to Understand Directional Differences: Use regular differences to see if values in one set are generally higher or lower compared to another set.
