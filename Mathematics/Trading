EXCHANGE RATE AND BASE CURRENCY

The ratio of currency a to b, and conversly the ratio of currenct b to a.

The base currency is the currency for which exchange rates are quoted relative to other currencies. 
For example, if we quote Rab Rab​, currency A is the base currency, and the rate tells us how much of currency B is equivalent to one unit of currency A.

SPREAD

1. The difference between the inverse of exchange rate b to a1 , and the exchange rate to a to b.
	-1/Rbs = Rab + Spread
	-Rba(Rab + spread) = 1

2. The exchange of Rba is the inverse of the Rab plus the spread.

PROFIT OF TRADE 

1.Take trade of currency a to b with opening exchange rate Rab', and investement A (in currency a) converted to B units of currency b = A(Rab').

2.The return is the conversion of B to  units of currency a, as per the closing exchange rate of Rba". 
	-B(Rba") = ARab'(Rba") 
	-Return = ARab'(Rba")
	 
3.The profit of trade is the difference between the return and the initial investment.
	-Profit = A[(Rab'(Rba") - 1]
	-Expressed in terms of Rab"
	-Profit = A[Rab'/(Rab" + Spread) - 1]

4.The Profit expressed in terms of currency of Investemnt (N) and currency of profit (p)
	-A = N(Rna')
	-P = Profit(Rap")
	-Profit(currency p) = N(Rna')(Rap")[Rab'/(Rab" + Spread) - 1]

SELLING/ BORROWING

1.The trade involves exchanging currency A for currency B, where currency A is borrowed. The borrowing fee is defined as the ratio (C%) of the borrowed amount A.

2.True Profit Calculation 
	The True Profit (or Loss) is calculated by deducting the borrowing fee from the Trade Profit:  
	-True Profit = Trade Profit - A * C%  
	-True Profit = A * (Rab' / (Rab" + Spread) - (1 + C%))

3.Amount gained derivation
 	If the Trade Profit is greater than or equal to the Borrowing Fee, the gains expressed in terms of currency P are calculated as follows:  
   - Where Rab' is the opening exchange rate of currency A to currency B, and Rab" is the closing exchange rate of currency A to currency B.  
   - If (Rab' / (Rab" + Spread)) ≥ (C% + 1), then:  
     Gains = A * Rap" * (Rab' / (Rab" + Spread) - (1 + C%))  
   - Here, Rap" is the closing exchange rate of the borrowed amount currency A to currency P.

4.Amount Owed Calculation
  If the Trade Profit is less than the Borrowing Fee, the amount owed expressed in terms of currency P is calculated as follows:  
  - If (Rab' / (Rab" + Spread)) < (C% + 1), then:  
    Loss = [A / Rpa"] * (Rab' / (Rab" + Spread) - (1 + C%))  
  - Here, Rpa" is the closing exchange rate of currency P to the borrowed amount currency A.
